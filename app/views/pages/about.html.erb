    <%= crosswords_dot_lol %> scrapes the daily quick crossword data from the source code of the <%= link_to "Guardian website", "https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/series/quick" %>
    and uses it to render a custom, mobile-optimised crossword UI (with a few extra bells and whistles added on top).
  </p>

  <p>
    Why? Because the Guardian crossword setters are great ❤️ but the website crossword UI has always been a bit 'basic' on mobile devices.
    So it seemed like a fun little project to try and build a nicer, more mobile-friendly app experience to complement their 👌 clue-setting.

    This is all (a bit cheekily) built on their data and it's always nice to say thank you 🙏

    I love doing <%= link_to "Guardian quick crosswords", "https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/series/quick" %>.
    But I've always found the Guardian website crossword UI a bit ðŸ’© on mobile devices - which is frustrating as I'm normally doing them on my phone.
  </p>
  <p>
    So I built <strong>crosswords.lol</strong> as a little side-project to provide an alternative, mobile-optimised interface for solving the excellent Guardian quick crossword clues.
  </p>
  <p>
    The app uses <%= link_to "Ruby on Rails", "https://rubyonrails.org/" %> for the backend and vanilla HTML/CSS with a sprinkling of <%= link_to "AlpineJS", "https://alpinejs.dev" %>
    for the UI. The underlying clue data is all (a little cheekily ðŸ™ˆ) scraped from the daily quick crossword pages on the Guardian website.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've also added a few extra features that I wanted to experiment with, including <span>timers</span> and <span>single-letter reveals</span>.
    More to come too!

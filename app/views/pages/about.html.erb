  <p>
    <%= crosswords_dot_lol %> scrapes the daily quick crossword data from the source code of the <%= link_to "Guardian website", "https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/series/quick" %>
    and uses it to render a custom, mobile-optimised crossword UI (with a few extra bells and whistles added on top).
  </p>

  <p>
    Why? Because the Guardian crossword setters are great <span class="emoji">❤️</span> but their website crossword
    <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> kinda sucks on mobile devices and can often be a bit frustrating to use.
  </p>

  <p>So it seemed like a fun little project to try and build a nicer, more mobile-friendly app experience to complement their <span class="emoji">👌</span> clue-setting.</p>

    If you enjoy using <%= crosswords_dot_lol %> then please consider heading over to the
    <%= link_to "Guardian website", "https://www.theguardian.com/" %> to donate / subscribe / click on some ads or something.
    This is all (a bit cheekily) built on their data and it's always nice to say thank you <span class="emoji">🙏</span>
